## about

This is the main page with links to most of the code on this website. Some are made by the owner of this website, while others are not.

## use

To use the tools, copy the command and decide on a method:

### console

Use this if you only intend to use the command once, as it can be anoying to repeat over and over.

1. Open the developer tools using `F12` or `CTRL+SHFT+I`.
2. Change to the console tab.
3. Paste the code into the console.
4. Press enter and you're done.

### bookmarklet

If the developer console is disabled in your browser, or you want to run it multiple times, use this method.

1. Create a new bookmark in your browser's bookmark manager.
2. Place the following contents into it:
`javascript: (() => { // paste code here! })();`
3. Replace the `// paste code here!` with the code of the exploit.
4. Press enter to run it.

### no code

In the case that the exploit does not require any code to be used, just follow the instructions of the exploit.
