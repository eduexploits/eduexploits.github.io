A collection of exploits discovered in lexia.

## about

This exploit collection was made by the owner of this website, and mostly is related to getting minutes. It is important to note that the minutes until Lexia won't let you open the category is different from the amount send to the teacher. The one sent to the teacher is less strict about AFK kicking. You can view this second number in the `My Progress` buton on the main menu.

## exploits

### idle minutes

This does not require any code and is useful if you have some free time, but don't want to or can't do Lexia due to not having headphones or good internet.

1. Open up Lexia PowerUp and open a topic.
2. Answer a few questions to get into answering mode.
3. Drag out the Lexia browser tab to it's own windows and make sure there are no other tabs in it.
4. You can minimize the tab and go do something.
5. After about five minutes, alt-tab back into the Lexia browser window and answer a question or two.
6. Repeat steps 4-5 until you want or need to stop.
7. Close the lesson and you're done.
